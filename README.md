**Conclusion**

The data shows that there were some failed kickstarters with really high goals. In order to launch a successful campaign the campaign should be launched in the summer months, preferably May. Campaigns that lasted a shorter amount of time, around 1 month, tended to be the most successful. The goal amount for the kickstarter should be $3,000.
